- The moving average filter is a common technique used to remove noise from a signal.

- It works by replacing each sample of the original signal with the average of the surrounding samples within a specified window.

- This window slides through the signal, one sample at a time, to calculate the average and create a filtered output.

- Delaying and advancing refer to the movement of the window through the signal.

- The window size determines how many samples are considered for calculating the average at each position.

- A larger window size includes more samples in the average calculation, resulting in a smoother output signal.

- However, increasing the window size also introduces more delay and reduces the ability to capture rapid changes in the original signal.

- Conversely, a smaller window size captures rapid changes more effectively but may produce a noisy output.

- Create a sine wave , and create range of signal to

- Using random , randn , to create noise with the length of the time of the sine wave signal range.

- Create noise function by using random , number of random is the lenght of sine wave signal
  
- and add the noise to the sine wave
